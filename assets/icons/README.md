# Icons

Since `nuxt-icon` use cdn requests for icons, use the simpler `nuxt-icons` with predownloaded icons.
Icons are from https://icones.js.org/collection/mdi.
Just download the svg version and put it in this folder, then use its name in code.

At some point if [Include Icons in build instead of doing network requests](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon/issues/34) is implemented we could go back to `nuxt-icon`
